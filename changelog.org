  One problem was that the mode line string I was using had mode line constructs.
  To get the proper measurements of the mode line so that I could right-align it I
  would use =string-pixel-width= on said string and then when passing them into
  =:eval= the mode line would expand them--often changing the width of the mode line
  string I had measured.  As a result, the mode line was always off.

  The other problem is I was not accounting for the fringe.
Modeline now does not "overflow"--all the segments are visible.  But sometimes
it fails to fill the entire window.
