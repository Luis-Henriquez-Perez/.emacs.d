installed.

The path of the straight directory within emacs is hardcoded into straight so we
need to trick it into thinking =VOID-PACKAGES-DIR= is the our emacs directory.
This needs to be done before bootstraping straight, else the straight directory
will be created anyway. I got this from Doom's straight branch.

I would prefer having only one souce of truth--the recipes; and only one place

I wrote this file such that the configure of each package has a headline that
contains the recipe of that package as org properties. This way I don't have to
maintain a separate file of recipes and each recipe is closely tied to the
configuration of each package. Additionally, this signals to the reader that
this is indeed an emacs package. And finally, this allows me to install all my
packages all at once at the start of my config.

To avoid loading org mode, I snatched the property drawer regexp from its source
code and use it to get the package recipes in my org file. I modified it so that
the keys between the property block delimiters were in their own group. This
makes it easier to acces them.

A straight recipe is represented as a plist in lisp. And in this config I signal
a heading corresponds to a package by putting the keys and values of the package
recipe as properties of the headline. That way, my main org file can be

There are numerous keybinding functions in Emacs; and they all look a little
different: there's [[helpfn:global-set-key][global-set-key]], [[helpfn:local-set-key][local-set-key]], [[helpfn:define-key][define-key]] and the list goes
on. And with [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil.git][evil]] which [[id:73366b3e-7438-4abf-a661-ed1553b1b8df][I use]] , there's also [[helpfn:evil-global-set-key][evil-global-set-key]] and
[[helpfn:evil-define-key][evil-define-key]]. It would be nice to have one keybinding function that can
handle all bindings. [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el.git][general]] provides such a function ([[helpfn:general-define-key][general-define-key]]).

As I've mentioned =general= uses the function =general-define-key= as a generic
do-all key binder. Sometimes though we have keys that we want to bind with
specific arguments to =general-define-key= pretty often. A typical example of
this is binding =leader= or =localleader= keys like [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(general-create-definer define-leader-key!

There's pros and cons to the =SPC m= binding. The main pro is that it's
consistent with =SPC=. With the leader and the localleader, this means that you
can reach any binding from just =SPC=. This means that you can discover all
bindings from just one root binding. This is a nice property to have. On the
other hand, bindings can get a bit long. That one extra character can really
make a difference. That's why.

Following past examples (such as), I initially opted for allowing keyword
arguments in the "function args" part of defun-like macros. This is fine when
there's only one keyword argument, but any more and it starts to get crowded. It
doesn't help that emacs functions tend towards longer names due to a lack of
namespaces. Therefore, I support keyword args in the function body.

The purpose of this macro is to fascillitate the creating of cut paste keywords
so often used in macros. Let me explain. Often you want a macro to be a
"front-end" so-to-speak for defining functions and variables that usually follow
a naming scheme. In the macro body we end up with many ~(intern (format
"foo-%s-baz" var))~ forms. This macro allows you to write this as ~foo-<var>-baz~
instead.

Anaphora refers to the ability to refer to. I have decided it is best to use
=<>= to denote the symbol referred to by anaphoric macros because it is easy to
type (assuming parentheses completion), because such a symbol uncommon in lisp.
A key advantage to this is that there is a consistent "syntax" for anaphoric
variables as opposed to using =it=. A consequence of this is that you have more
flexibility to name variables. Additionally, I like that it looks like a slot or
placeholder.

One of the most common ways to customize Emacs is via [[info:elisp#Hooks][hooks]]. Hooks are variables
containing functions (also referred to as hooks). The functions in hooks are run
after certain events, such as starting and quitting emacs. Their purpose is to
fascillitate customization of what happens before or after particular events.

In this headline, I strive to establish a common naming convention for
Void-defined hooks, so I can clearly distinguish them from pre-defined hooks.

which hook variable a function resides in based on looking at the name

example). This proves to be useful for [[id:8506fa78-c781-4ca8-bd58-169cce23a504][expire advice]].

[[info:elisp#Advising Functions][Advising]] is one of the most powerful ways to customize emacs's behavior. In this

intended to advise other functions and to ensure that these functions are named
properly. All user-defined advising functions should have the format

it's possible for a given advice to advise multiple functions. With the naming

Often there are functions you want to advise just once. For example, loading a
feature just before a function that needs it is called. Although it's harmless,
you don't want to keep reloading the feature everytime the function is called.
The way I handle this situation is by creating a function that generates an
=expire-advice=. When an =expire-advice= it will.

Note that this function returns must be evaluated with lexical binding to work.

A big contributor to long startup times is the garbage collector. When

increase the [[helpvar:gc-cons-threshold][gc-cons-threshold]], or the /number of bytes of consing between
garbage collections/. The default value is usually too low for modern machines.

[[helpvar:minibuffer-setup-hook][minibuffer-setup-hook]] and [[helpvar:minibuffer-exit-hook][minibuffer-exit-hook]] are the hooks run just before
entering and exiting the minibuffer (respectively). In the minibuffer I'll be
primarily doing searches for variables and functions. There are alot of
variables and functions so this can certainly get computationally expensive. To
keep things snappy I increase boost the [[helpvar:gc-cons-threshold][gc-cons-threshold]] just before I enter
the minibuffer, and restore it to it's original value a few seconds after it's closed.

It would take me forever to guess the name =minibuffer-setup-hook= from the
variable [[helpvar:minibuffer-exit-hook][minibuffer-exit-hook]]. If I knew the name =minibuffer-exit-hook= but did not
know what the hook to enter the minibuffer was, I'd probably
=minibuffer-enter-hook= because [[https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-opposite-of/exit.html]["enter" is one of the main antonyms of "exit"]].
It'd take me forever to guess =startup=. Note that the only tricky thing about
this example.

At first I thought of =entry= but after more thought I realized
hook variables use action verbs in their names not nouns. So the =exit= in
=minibuffer-exit-hook= is actually the verb =exit= not the noun.

When eval and replacing expressions, I want the printed result to express all
newlines in strings as =\n= as opposed to an actual newline. In fact, in general I
want any character to be expressed in =backslash + number or character= form. It
makes the strings more readable and easier to deal with.

Furthermore, I'd like printed lisp expressions to express quoted forms the way I
write them, with a ='= as opposed to the literal =(quote ...)=.

There comes a point when output is too long, or too nested to be usable. It's ok
to abbreviate it at this point.

I want Void to be flexible when choosing a font. I create a list of my preferred
fonts in =void-backup-fonts=. They are in order of most preferred to least
preferred. To compute the value of =void-font=, Void checks each of these fonts
in turn for the first available font. If none is availabe it just uses the
system font.

This process is time consuming (at least relative to the total emacs startup
time). But it benefits from byte-compilation.

There is a need to save buffers and window configurations in their own groups.
Often we'll have a group of buffers we've setup to work on a project or task and
suddenly, in the middle of that task we'll want to work on another task. It's
inconvenient to get rid of the window configuration we've set up just to have to
come back to it and set it up again. This is what workspaces, also called
workgroups, are for. You can save the window configuration you're using and
switch to a new one.

Workgroup provides a. One notable advantage of workgroups is that it does not
use emacs's built-in serialization of window configs. Usually, it is better to
use something that's built-in. However, emacs's serialization has the drawback
that it's not a lisp object; implying that it is not.

:TYPE:     built-in
:END:

Emacs can add border to windows using a mode called [[helpfn:window-divider-mode][window-divider-mode]].
Often in emacs you have multiple windows displaying different buffers on the
screen. By default the border between these windows is very thin, so it can be
hard to distinguish windows sometimes. The point of adding borders to windows is
to distinguish them easily from one another.

Window dividers are useful in general so I don't get confused about when one
window ends and another begins (see [[helpfn:window-divider-mode][window-divider-mode]]). When using [[I like emacs][exwm]] it
makes emacs feel like a window manager with gaps.

[[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] (Emacs X-Window Manager) is a full-featured window manager in Emacs.
There are benefits and drawbacks to making emacs your window manager. One
benefit is that you get a super consistent window management experience. If you
use a typical window manager, you have to.

In fact, EXWM does not need to be loaded on startup. It is only needed when you
actually want to open another application such as a separate Emacs instance or
the web browser. This is great because EXWM actually does consume significant
startup time. Instead of loading =EXWM= immediately, I add advises to the
functions which open external linux applications.

A common dream among many Org users is to integrate [[info:org#Capture][org-capture]] into their browser.
Indeed, the browser by nature would be a place you'd want to capture from a lot.
However, since graphical browsers are not in emacs the main way to do this was
via a hacky and difficult to set up [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]].

Storing the links is better, but not good enough. Webpages die. They can be
taken off by a third-party or removed by the owner themselves. Even if they
aren't though, they can be modified so that what you originally found isn't
there anymore. As a solution for this I came upon [[https://wkhtmltopdf.org/][wkhtmltopdf]], a command that
downloads a given webpage as pdf. A consequence of doing this is that you will
have access to all the webpages you used for research offline.

The dream is to do all text editing in Emacs. This package is a big step towards
achieving that dream. =exwm-edit= allows the user to edit text fields in
external packages with an emacs buffer. It acts a lot like =org-edit-src-code=:
it copies any text in the text field to a buffer, you edit the buffer, then
press a binding to insert the buffer text into the text field. It goes without
saying that when the text is in an emacs buffer, you can use the full-force of
Emacs's text editing capabilities on it.

Completion has certainly become an integral part of any efficient workflow. One
commonality among things like searching emails, code-completing a word, surfing
the web is that in one way or another all of these things involve the suggestion
of likely candidates from a population that is too time consuming to look
through on our own. It's not much different in Emacs. We're constantly sifting
though files, buffers, commands, words--all to try to get through to the subset
of things that we actually want at this moment.

In today's world communication is largely done via emails. Whether at work or at
school it's common to receive emails every day. In fact, you hear of people that
have 20,000+ emails in a particular account. Unsurprisingly, when we're getting
so many emails, it's easy to become overwhelmed. Fortunately, there are numerous
ways to read and send emails in Emacs.

The most popular emacs mail client is =mu4e=. And, there is good reason why. =mu4e=
has many juicy features. Overall, =mu4e= is definitely a great mail client.
However, it's not all roses and rainbows; it does have a few annoying quicks.
One is that unlike virtually all other emacs packages it does not come decoupled
from =mu=. Another is that it is hard to set up multiple accounts properly despite
it's [[explicit support]] for multiple accounts. =mu4e= comes bundled with =mu=. A
significant advantage of using it is it's the most popular option and,
therefore, has the most support (in the form of setup blogs and packages).

Mu4e certainly gave me some trouble setting up multiple accounts despite [its
attempt] to make this easy. I have one directory =~/.mail= where which stores all
my mail. The subdirectories of =~/.mail= correspond to my individual email
accounts. Until I set multiple accounts correctly it keeps prompting me to
create folders (such as =sent/=) in the =~/.mail= directory. I think part of the
reason I spent so much time setting this up is because.

[[http://w3m.sourceforge.net/][w3m]] is a text-based web browser. There are many other text-based browsers out
there, but =w3m= has the benefit of having comprehensive [[https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m][emacs interface]]. Why
use this when you can use the GUI browser? Well, using the Emacs interface I can
view an Emacs webpage as plain text, which means I can perform searches on it
with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper.git][swiper]], or any other Emacs operation on it. Another advantage is that
because the w3m interface's backend is a terminal application, it will (I'm
guessing; no benchmarks made) typically be faster than browsers at rendering
plain text webpages. Of course, the main limitation is that w3m will typically
only display text based web pages well--not ones with lots of interactive
javascript code.

Pictures or GIFs of behaviors can relate emacs behaviors in away descriptions
cannot. From my experience looking at posts on [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/][emacs stackexchange]] or
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/][emacs-reddit]] or even other [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][emacs configs]], screenshots are underutilized (or
often not utilized at all).

There are three screenshot packages I know of [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/screenshot][screenshot]], [[https://github.com/dakra/scrot.el][scrot]] and [[https://github.com/atykhonov/escr][escr]]. But
they all have their downsides. Screenshot's main command, =screenshot=, assumes
that you want. =escr= doesn't provide prompt you for the filename or provide any
option that would prompt you for the file name.

=escr= doesn't prompt for the filename. While this is faster in the shortrun and
may be useful for situations when you're short on time, it does mean that I'll
need to invest time in looking at the screenshots again so you can properly name
them.

It's nice to have cursors change colors (and sometimes shape) depending on the
current evil state. It makes it easy to tell which state you're in. I define
some colors here. Evil has a cursor variable for each state. The cursor variable
for insert state, for example, is [[helpvar:evil-insert-state-cursor][evil-insert-state-cursor]]. Its value is of the
form: ~((CURSOR-SHAPE . CURSOR-WIDTH) COLOR)~.

**** text objects

:END:

To edit text efficiently Vim has the concept of [[https://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/][text objects]]. Text objects are
structures that are seen in text. For example, a set of words followed by a
period is a sentence. A words between two closing parentheses is a sexp.

***** general delimiter text object

:END:

I discovered this the =form= text object from using [[https://github.com/luxbock/evil-cleverparens][evil-cleverparens]] in the past.
The package =evil-cleverparens= was too slow for my taste; noctuid's [[https://github.com/sp3ctum/evil-lispy][evil-lispy]] is
much faster and gave me the functionality that I needed most from
=evil-cleverparens=: deleting and copying text with parentheses intelligently.
However, many of the ideas of =evil-cleverparens= were excellent. One particular
idea was to have a general =form= text object. Instead of specifying the
particular surrounding bounds when doing an evil operator command you just use a
single key for them. It's kind of like a =Do-What-I-Mean= surround operator. This
is suprisingly useful because it takes significant time to specify whether you
want =[]= or ={=}= or =()= or =""=. The main drawback you cannot distinguish between
surround characters at multiple levels--it just takes the closest one. In
practice, this is rarely an issue.

=Vim= and =Evil= both have the interesting (inconsistent?) behavior that doing an
outer text object operator on a comment grabs some whitespace on the left side.
Try doing =va"= to ~(progn "hello world")~ and you'll see that =\s"hello world"= is
selected instead of just "hello world".

Why not just go to the end of the ="= like any other around operator?

portable and customizable as emacs itself. It can run elisp functions as
commands. There's a good article about it in [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell][mastering-emacs]]. Other articles I
have like about eshell: [[https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/][ambrevar's eshell post]], [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/eshell-fun.html][Howard Abram's Post]].

The shell often gets cluttered with many commands. It's often useful to clear it
and indeed there are many suggestions on how to do so online. However, many of
them involve erasing the eshell buffer or making it's previous contents
inaccessable. I don't like getting rid of information that could be important.
All I really wanted is to just scroll up to the top of the window so that the
previous contents weren't visible. Note that it is important that this command
returns nil. Eshell shell ignores output returns nil. However, when it returns
non-nil it prints it to the eshell buffer, which results in a residue
line--that's not what we want.

case-sensitive so consider this if your tags (like me) capitalized. The

posts. So if you have some infrequent blogs, you might have to go further back

To avoid losing information. You should commit often in git--like every 10
seconds or so. Obviously doing this manually on the command line (or even on
[[id:d6088ed3-417a-44e8-822b-ce4743f497d0][magit]]) every time is a pain. This package commits your changes every time
you save your file--which for me is all the time because I use [[id:bd455e73-4035-49b9-bbdf-3d59d4906c97][super-save]].

Committing often as I recommend will inevitably result with commits that are
many bits and pieces of a change. The idea is to then squash together all
related commits for the "polished" result. With this function I create "smart"
commit messages that take advantage of the org headline structure. This makes it
easy to go back and group commits which are related. Note that this function
fails when you have a change that spans across multiple headlines (such as the
replacement of a name throughout a document). This is something I plan to
address later.

The default auto-saving feature in emacs saves after a certain number of
characters are typed (see [[helpvar:auto-save-interval][auto-save-interval]]). The problem is that if you're in
the middle of typing and you've just hit the number of characters that trigger a
save, you could experience a lag, particularly if you are dealing with a large
file being saved. Instead of doing this, [[https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save][super-save]] saves buffers during idle
time and after certain commands like [[helpfn:switch-to-buffer][switch-to-buffer]] (see [[helpvar:super-save-triggers][super-save-triggers]]).
Note that this is the same strategy employed by [[id:c550f82a-9608-47e6-972b-eca460015e3c][idle-require]] to load packages.
Saving files like this reduces the likelihood of user delays.

**** fix elisp indentation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: aa7f846f-8802-4c75-88d8-a438e2f63ccd
:END:

A problem with elisp indentation is indents quoted lists the way functions
should be indented. It has been discussed in at least three stackoverflow
questions [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10230/how-to-indent-keywords-aligned/10233#10233][here]], [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49222433/align-symbols-in-plist][here]] and [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22166895/customize-elisp-plist-indentation][here]]. In all these questions the solutions have not
been satisfactory. Some of them recommend using [[helpfn:common-lisp-indent-function][common-lisp-indent-function]] as
the value of [[helpvar:lisp-indent-function][lisp-indent-function]]. This works for indenting a quoted list
properly, but at the expense of changing the way that many other elisp forms are
indented. Common Lisp's indentation is different from Elisp's. Others recommend
using [[https://github.com/Fuco1/.emacs.d/blob/af82072196564fa57726bdbabf97f1d35c43b7f7/site-lisp/redef.el#L12-L94][Fuco1's lisp indent function hack]]. This also is not ideal. For one thing it
only works for quoted lists with keywords but not generic symbols. Another thing
is that the change should really be occurring in [[helpfn:calculate-lisp-indent][calculate-lisp-indent]].
~calculate-lisp-indent~ is a function that returns what the indentation should be
for the line at point. Since Fuco1 did not modify ~calculate-lisp-indent~ the
*wrong* indentation still returned by this function and the modified
~lisp-indent-function~ just cleans up the mess. Better is just fixing the source
of the problem. You can check out a more in-depth explanation looking at my
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/d7x7x8/finally_fixing_indentation_of_quoted_lists/][reddit-post]] or looking at an answer I gave to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10230/how-to-indent-keywords-aligned][this question]].

from elisp to org. My [[helpvar:VOID-INIT-FILE][void-init-file]] is written with =outshine= in mind.

** org
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 7fd3bb4f-354c-4427-914c-9de2223f5646
:END:

Org mode introduces an elegant way of dealing with different languages in one
file. In an org file the background language is Org's own markup language that's
typically composed mostly of outline headlines. In the org markup language you
can embed multiple different languages in [[info:org#Editing Source Code][source blocks]]. Additionally, org
mode provides a library of functions for dealing with these files. This includes
things like executing (or evaluating) source blocks, moving headlines to other
files, or even converting an org mode document into another format. As the name
=org= suggests, org is tool that's used for organization of data.

*** do the right thing after jumping to headline
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2ca61454-a0ca-47b3-8622-91d7969653da
:END:

When I search for a headline with [[helpfn:void/goto-line][void/goto-line]] or [[helpfn:void/goto-headline][void/goto-headline]] or even their
counsel equivalents, the proper headlines aren't automatically revealed.

[[screenshot:][This]] is what headline structure looks after using counsel/ivy's [[helpfn:swiper][swiper]] to find
the word =void/goto-line= in my emacs. You can see that only the headline that has
the target word is revealed but it's parents are (akwardly) hidden. I never want
headlines to be unfolded like this.

**** show branch
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d95fab52-7d8f-439f-9221-188490f4ad5f
:END:

This shows all headlines that make up the branch of the current headine and
their children. This is the typical behavior you would expect in any outlining
program.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org:show-branch ()
  "Reveal the current org branch.

headline."
  (let (points)
    (save-excursion
      (org-back-to-heading t)
      (push (point) points)
      (while (org-up-heading-safe)
        (push (point) points))

        (goto-char it)

**** show branch after jumping to point
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       251e5df0-0a7d-4bf9-8fd9-69991d89a074
:END:

Note that I use points to store the heading points and go back to them inreverse
order. This is important because org does not unfold headlines properly if you
start from an invisible subheading.

Notably, I do not try to conserve the return value of =void/goto-line= or
=void/jump-to-headline= because these functions are and should only be used for
their side-effects.

Annoyingly, the first time you call org/goto-headline, a prompt from

canceled. I had a damingly difficult time figuring out where exactly this

=org-goto-location= seems to work. If I end up having some problems with other

create a transient advice that only happens the first time the function is

To be honest, org mode has some pretty ugly syntax. The asterixes at the
beginning of a heading are ugly, org block end and begin lines are ugly,
property drawers are ugly. For a nice-looking, minimal, and non-distracting
appearance all this needs to be improved.

Sometimes I have questions that I want to record. It's kind of like a more
specific =TODO= because their "task" is always to be answered. I think it's
worth distinguishing them from tasks in which I need to perform an action that I
have no questions about. The purpose of this template is for problems and issues
I'm stumped on. This process can help me reason through as much as I can and
provide the perfect draft for a potential question for reddit or stackexchange.

Emacs is full of so many keybindings, that it can be difficult to keep track of
them. Especially when you're starting out, but even when you're an Emacs-pro,
it's easy to forget what a particular functionality is bound to. Typically,
you'll remember the first few key strokes but struggle with the rest. To address
this [[github:][which-key]] displays key binding sequences in the minibuffer as your typing
them ([[][]] and [[][]] are screenshots of this in action). By doing this
you can "discover" the commands as you go along.

[[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][dashboard]] is an extensible emacs startup screen. I love the idea of =dashboard=:
having an extensible, fast, nice-looking dashboard when starting emacs is
nice. It's not only nice asthetically, it's also strategic too. First, you can
use it as a launching point to get to your tasks quicker. And second, it doesn't
require any expensive modes. I've often been starting out with the scratch
buffer and I've wanted to have the scratch buffer start off with
=emacs-lisp-mode=, but I don't want it to trigger =company=, =yasnippet=, etc. on
startup. If I start my emacs with =dashboard= I can avoid this.

Feebleline replaces the typical emacs modeline with text printed out to
echo area.

Why use this instead of a typical modeline (such as doom-modeline,
telephone-line, smart-mode-line, etc.)? The problem with typical emacs modelines
is that they appear in every buffer. This means they do not scale well in terms
of screen space because each additional vertical window means another line
dedicated to the modeline. Moreover, more modelines aren't even more useful,
it's just excess information you don't need to know unless you're visiting the
buffer. Better is a global modeline that displays the information from the
buffer displayed in the currently selected window.

It's really easy to add new segments to this modeline.

There are those who insist on the usefulness of line numbers and column number.
I'm not one of them. I rarely ever need to use a specific line number or column

A little bit of decoration and spice can go a long way. As its name suggests,
[[all-the-icons][all-the-icons]] is a package that contains a lot of icons ([[][here]] you can see
a few). In practice I use these icons to (1) make things look nicer and more
colorful and (2) enhance readability of plain text.

In emacs, we change the buffer a window's displaying pretty often. That's why
efficient buffer navigation is a must. There are particular buffers which I
visit so often that it's worth having keybindings just for them.

There's many ways to quit Emacs. Sometimes I'd like to save all the buffers I
had been working on. Sometimes, when I'm testing something and I mess up
[[helpvar:kill-emacs-hook][kill-emacs-hook]] I want Emacs to just quit even if it means ignoring that hook.
Most of the time, I know what I'm doing when I quit Emacs, so I don't want a
prompt asking me if I'm sure.
