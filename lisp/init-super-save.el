(hook! on-first-file-hook super-save-mode)
;; The default auto-saving feature in emacs saves after a certain number of
;; characters are typed (see [[helpvar:auto-save-interval][auto-save-interval]]).  The problem is that if you're in
;; the middle of typing and you've just hit the number of characters that trigger a
;; save, you could experience a lag, particularly if you are dealing with a large
;; file being saved.  Instead of doing this, [[https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save][super-save]] saves buffers during idle
;; time and after certain commands like [[helpfn:switch-to-buffer][switch-to-buffer]] (see [[helpvar:super-save-triggers][super-save-triggers]]).
;; Note that this is the same strategy employed by [[id:c550f82a-9608-47e6-972b-eca460015e3c][idle-require]] to load packages.
;; Saving files like this reduces the likelihood of user delays.
