;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Compared to `base-utils' this library has functions that on external
;; packages loaded in `base-requirements'.

;; This file contains functions and macros directly used for customizing Emacs
;; by which I mean for doing things like adding hooks, adding advices, and
;; setting variables for a particular feature.  Basically tools for configuring

;; So remember with `oo-after-load-hash-table' that we push the elements in so if we
;; loop through it normally the first item processed is actually the last item
;; we entered into the list. I personally would expect the items to be processed
;; in the order I added them.

;; This is actually trickier than it seems.  Before I used to push the elements
;; I did not touch into a list and simply set the value of
;; `oo-after-load-hash-table' to that list.  But surprisingly, some
;; elements of the alist would disappear.  A long while later I realized why: a
;; side-effect of this looping is modifying the list.  By setting.  Instead, I
;; need to keep track of the elements I will remove.
