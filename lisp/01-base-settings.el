;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Here lies a collection of built-in settings that I want to take effect
;; immediately.  Many of them have to do with disabling default Emacs behaviors
;; that I don't like. I specifically place them at the forefront of my configuration
;; to ensure that they will always be evaluated regardless of what unexpected error
;; should occur afterwards.

;; In qtile this does not allow emacs to go completely fullscreen.
(setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
;;;;; load newer files
(setq-default load-prefer-newer t)
;;;;; by default do not wrap lines
;; When a line is too long to be displayed in the screen do not wrap it around;
;; just let the rest of the line go out of view (with an indicator that there is
;; more to the line in the fringe).  Although I can see the whole line when it
;; wraps around, I find it makes the text confusing and harder to read.  If I
;; want this, then I will toggle it myself with [[][toggle-truncate-lines]].
(setq-default truncate-lines t)
;;;;; show newlines as =\n= instead of an actual newline
;; They are easier to deal with and do not occupy unnecessary lines.
(setq print-escape-newlines t)
;;;;; set the fill-column 80 by default
(setq-default fill-column 80)
;;;;; use =yes-or-no-p= instead of =y-or-n-p=
;; Essentially, I am telling all Emacs functions that prompt the user for a =yes=
;; or =no= to instead allow me to type =y= or =p=.  [[helpfn:yes-or-no-p][yes-or-no-p]] is defined in c
;; source code.
(advice-add #'yes-or-no-p :override #'y-or-n-p)
;;;;; don't create lockfiles
(setq create-lockfiles nil)

;; Do not create backup files ever.
(setq version-control 'never)
;;;;; don't flash unstyled modeline at startup
;; When emacs starts up, the default modeline will show up.  Rendering this default
;; modeline at startup does slightly slow down emacs (insignificant on it's own but
;; these things add up).  So I disable it.
;; (setq-default mode-line-format nil)
;;;;; don't ask me whether I want to kill a buffer with a live process
;; I got this from [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/disabling-prompts-emacs][this-post]].  Every time you try to kill a buffer with a live
;; process, Emacs will ask you if you're sure you want to kill it.
(setq kill-buffer-query-functions (remq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function kill-buffer-query-functions))
;;;;; move files to trash instead of deleting them
;; By default Emacs actually deletes files.  By setting this to t, you tell Emacs
;; to move a file to trash instead of actually deleting it.  This is better because
;; if you accidentally delete a file or discover you can still just go get your
;; file from the trash.
(setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t)
;;;;; enable recursive minibuffer
;; With this enabled, I can invoke the minibuffer while still being in the
;; minibuffer.  At the very least this is useful so that I can inspect which keys
;; are bound in the minibuffer.
(setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
;;;;; recenter point if it goes 20 lines past what is visible
;; Note that the following comment is taken from noctuid's config: "Recenter the
;; point if it goes greater than 20 lines past what is visible the default, 0, is
;; kind of annoying because it recenters even if you just go one line down from
;; the window bottom, but a higher value is nice to automatically recenter after
;; any bigger jump."

;;;;; skip fontification functions when there's input pending

;;;;; don't echo keystrokes
;; By default emacs shows.

;;;;; set the tab-width to =4=; it's =8= by default

;;;;; don't beep
;; This variable controls whether emacs makes a sound when certain events happen
;; such as invoking a binding that doesn't have anything bound to it or trying
;; to exceed the end of the buffer--things like that.  Personally, I don't want
;; such beeping.  Setting this variable to nil still result in beeping, emacs
;; just uses its default function.  Instead, to be disabled it must
;; be set to [[file:snapshots/helpful-command:ignore.png][ignore]].
(setq ring-bell-function #'ignore)
;;;;; disable repeated error message functions
;; When you try to move past the beginning and end of a buffer Emacs produces
;; error messages.

;;;;; Prevent devaralias from generating a warning
;; The built-in package `woman' overwrites the existing variable
;; `woman-topic-history' by aliasing it to `Man-topic-history' and emacs tells
;; you this by popping up a *Warnings* buffer whenever woman.el is loaded.  This
